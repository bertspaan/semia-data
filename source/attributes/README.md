This directory contains `openbeelden_colour.hdf5`, a [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) file with data about the most prominent colors in each shot in each video from [Open Images](https://openbeelden.nl/). This file was created by [Nanne van Noord](https://nanne.github.io/) from the University of Amsterdam.

Upon request, three more files are available which contain more video analysis data:

- `openbeelden_vc.hdf5`: visual clutter/complexity for each shot;
- `openbeelden_flow.hdf5`: direction of movement for each shot;
- `openbeelden_resnet.hdf5`: numerical output from shape detection neural network.

These files were too large to include in this GitHub repository.
